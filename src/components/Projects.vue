          <p>With mostly technical consulting we have prominent customers in and around germany.</p>
          <p>Currently, I'm supporting a company in the implementation of a modern micro service architecture for a nationwide network of traffic control, access control and monitoring systems.

          <p>An important success factor is the sophisticated commission model of indirect sales, the technical development of which was my responsibility. Technical focus was on Java 11, Spring Boot, maven, Docker, grails, IBM ODM, postgreSQL and Sybase ASE.</p>
          <p>In addition to technical development and expansion, constantly growing demands and changing regulations require quick reaction time, good concepts and excellent communication skills.</p>
          <p>I also organized and participated in concern-wide tech-talks, Java User Group and supported the company on Job fairs, hackathons, etc.</p>

          <p>I completed my three-year professional training at HM Buchdata in Frankfurt, a system house with a broad customer base in the non-profit and public sectors and the economy.</p>
          <p>During my training I learned how to work in a structured way, how to deal with customers in a professional manner and how to respect experience. This demanded a lot of patience from my trainer, as I found other skills more important at the age of 15.</p>
          <p>However, my experience in programming enabled me to automate some internal processes, accelerate migrations and support my colleagues. After graduation I left the company immediately due to several moral concerns.</p>
